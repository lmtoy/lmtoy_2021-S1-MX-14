## OBSNUM

First night beams 14,15 really bad. 8 maps taken. Not till 99561 did those two come back.
beam 0 always bad -
beam 5 sometimes a bit (check, we included it) - 
beam 2 or 6 might have the birdy, but it's in the line region. Still, it gives bad maps,
so before we do proper birdie flagging, take beams 2 and 6 out as well.


More detailed descriptions are in the file **mk_runs.py**.
